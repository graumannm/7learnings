# 7Learnings Data Science Challenge
This repository contains a notebook for the data science coding challenge for 7Learnings. The dataset is a time series dataset with wheather data from a number of weather stations. The task is to predict whether it will snow tomorrow. 

# Overview

### Installations
Install packages that were not included in the requirements.txt fil.e

### Imports
Import packages.

### Introduction
Description of the tasks.

# Part 1.
### Task 1
Extract data and filter for years and wheather stations using Big Query. Save data as a pandas dataframe.

### Task 2
Take a smaller subset from the wheather stations. Clean and prepare the data.
- Remove columns
- Fill missing values
- Inspect outliers
- Feature engineering
- data exploration

### Task 3
Split data into trainig, evaluation and test set. The test set contains the data of tomorrow 15 years ago.

# Part 2
Train classification model on time series data to predict whether it will snow tomorrow 15 years ago using the dataset prepared in part 1.

### Training and validation
I am using a simple logistic regression as a baseline model.

### Testing on tomorrow's data

# Conclusion
